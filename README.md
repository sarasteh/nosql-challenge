# nosql-challenge
In this challenge I analyzed the hygiene ratings data of various establishments across the United Kingdom provided by UK Food Standards Agency. Input data was imported from the *establishments.json* inside the Resource folder. The nosql-challenge folder includes the following Jupyter notebook files:

--------------
> #### 1. NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb 
- The code that imports the data and sets up and updates the uk_food database.
>  #### 2. NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb 
- The code that performs the exploratory analysis queries in the database.
