# nosql-challenge
In this challenge I analyzed the hygiene ratings data of various establishments across the United Kingdom provided by UK Food Standards Agency. Input data was imported from the *establishments.json*. The folder includes the following Jupyter notebook files:

--------------
> - The code that imports the data and sets up and updates the uk_food database (NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb).
> - The code that performs the exploratory analysis queries in the database (NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb).
